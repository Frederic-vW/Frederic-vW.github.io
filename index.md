# Resting-state EEG

Multi-channel EEG activity is usually analyzed by looking at the set of single channel time series:

Multivariate time series are difficult to visualize. In motion, surface electrical activity looks more like this:

The animation is slowed down 16 times compared to real-life oscillations. In other words, the 100 second animation represents 6.25 seconds real EEG time.
The oscillatory activity over the occipital part of the brain has a main frequency of approximately 11 Hz, i.e. within the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz).

## Discrete EEG patterns

### EEG microstate analysis

#### Clustering
To find some representative EEG topographies, data vectors taken at peaks of the GFP time course are passed through a clustering procedure. e.g. the modified K-means algorithm. The EEG shown above contains 61 different channels, so clustering occurs in a 61-dimensional space. As this is impossible to visualize, a two-dimensional projection ([t-SNE algorithm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) can be seen here, where each of the four microstates is represented with a different colour (A: black, B: blue, C: red, D: yellow):

In two dimensions, the clustering does not look great, reflecting the continuous nature of EEG topographic patterns discussed below.

The idea behing the method is to represent each instantaneous EEG topography by only one of the four microstates. This is best shown in a movie: the continuous 2-20 Hz EEG is on the left, and the best fitting microstate is on the right. Of note, polarity (red/blue) is ignored.

## Continuous EEG patterns

### Amplitude and phase patterns
At each EEG electrode, amplitude-modulates oscillations are observed. These can be characterized completely by their analytic amplitude and analytic phase.

### Statistical characteristics of microstate sequences
Microstate sequences can characterized by the probability distribution of the microstate labels, and the transition matrix $T$, which contains the conditional probabilities of a transition from label $S_i$ at time $t$ to label $S_j$ at time $t+1$.
### Markovianity
A stationary first-order Markov process is fully described by its initial symbol distribution $p_0$, and its transition matrix $T_{ij}$.
