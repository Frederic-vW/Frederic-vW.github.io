### Statistical characteristics of microstate sequences

Microstate sequences can characterized by the probability distribution of the microstate labels, and the transition matrix $T$, which contains the conditional probabilities of a transition from label $S_i$ at time $t$ to label $S_j$ at time $t+1$.

### Markovianity
A stationary first-order Markov process is fully described by its initial symbol distribution $p_0$, and its transition matrix $T_{ij}$.

### Microstate periodicity

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Frederic-vW/Frederic-vW.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
